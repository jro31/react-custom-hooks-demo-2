The second project based on *'Section 15: Building Custom React Hooks'* of Academind's *['React - The Complete Guide'](https://acad.link/reactjs)* course, this repo has commits of examples of:

* Creating a `useHttp()` custom hook - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-custom-hooks-demo-2/commit/3194cae56d8c3af2667deedff8029396a68f52ba)
* Update `useHttp()` to be called without any parameters or dependencies - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-custom-hooks-demo-2/commit/da70c126365d9393f919707297fdc339dd764952)
* Use `useHttp()` in a second (`NewTask`) component - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-custom-hooks-demo-2/commit/c60aaee17d93cae1de7d2fd21a768a7730ddb560)
* There's also a bonus commit, explaining what's happening with the `NewTask` component, and in what order (because I found it a bit confusing, so spent a while figuring it out) - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/react-custom-hooks-demo-2/commit/ecf78ca6ce8fcc64813e0ab9446d01f48b2e3c91)
